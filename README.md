# UAV-Localization
This project is for UAV localization with the help of UMA_16.

The folder `UMA_16` is hardware testing and audio recording by using UMA_16. Windows users should install driver first `miniDSP_UAC2_v4.82_Drivers.7z`, if not, system crash will occur.

Sound problem may occur with VMware, please avoid using Ubuntu on VMware to record sound.

The folder `Acoustic_Camera` is code to track sound source.

The folder `Sim_ROS2` is code to simulate environment and sound source in gazebo & ROS2 for further development.

These 3 folders are separate.
